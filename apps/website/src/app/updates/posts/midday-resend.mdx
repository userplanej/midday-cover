<br />
Here at Midday, we care deeply about design, and we knew from the beginning that
we wanted branded emails with reusable components.

<br />
By integrating [react.email](https://react.email/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://react.email/docs/components/tailwind),
we've crafted an optimal user experience. **This combination has been transformative**,
allowing us to enable our local development and online hosting.

<br />
The transition to Resend was strikingly smooth. I'm used to other services where
you need to request access, quotes, and other information before getting started.
From sign up, to implementing the SDK, Resend was different - **we were setup in
less than an hour.**

<br />
We use Resend to ensure that our clients receive notifications for new bank transactions,
invitations, and other significant interactions. What truly sets Resend apart for
us are the continuous changes and improvements, like the Batch API, which specifically
helped optimize our invite system.

<br />

I didn't think that you could further innovate an email API, but **Resend keeps
shipping features that we did not know we needed.**

<br />
We haven't had the need to contact Resend for support yet, but the team has supported
us while we shared our journey building emails on X, which truly showed me how **they
differ from other email providers in the best way.**

<br />
I'm really excited for our launch, along side my co-founder Viktor Hofte.

<br />
Resend is a **game changer when it comes to developer experience and design.** If
you care deeply about your product you should use Resend.
