In this release, we’re introducing three major updates along with a few helpful additions. You’ll enjoy a much better inbox experience with improved company names, logos, and bulk upload using drag-and-drop. Plus, our Assistant has received several upgrades.

## Inbox

We have rebuilt our Inbox to extract information more reliably and quickly. You can now bulk upload using drag-and-drop, and we will reconcile these with your transactions.

#### Bulk Uploading (Finally!)
Easily upload multiple files at once with our new drag-and-drop feature.

#### Improved Accuracy 
Experience higher accuracy in identifying names, amounts, and logos.

## Assistant

We have updated our assistant to be nearly 30% faster thanks to GPT-4o and several performance improvements in our data layer.
 
#### Create Reports 
You can now create reports directly from the Assistant.
 
#### Documents (Beta) 
Upload documents and ask questions around them.
 
#### Voice (Alpha)
We are exploring new ways to interact with your Assistant using voice commands.

Thanks to our new engine, you can now search for your bank directly. It's much more reliable, and you can view the status of your connection. You can also manually sync your connection in the Settings.
 
#### Search for banks
It's now possible to just search for your bank.
 
#### Connection status
Sometimes, the connection to your bank may change. We now clearly display this in the Settings and provide instructions on how to resolve it, either through a sync or a reconnection.
 
#### Reconnect flow
Especially for banks in the EU, you need to reconnect your bank every 3-6 months. We now send a reminder email and provide an easy flow that takes just 60 seconds to get you back on track.

## What's coming next
 
#### Time Tracker
Our time tracker will soon includes real-time tracking capabilities, allowing you to monitor productivity and manage your time more effectively.
 
#### Invoicing
We have started developing our invoice feature and have created designs based on feedback from many of you to ensure the best possible experience.
 
#### Multi-Currency Support
Soon, you will gain a clear picture of your business finances, even if you operate with multiple currencies.
