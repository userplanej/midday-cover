## Introduction

Midday's codebase is set up in a monorepo via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://git.new/midday).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── api
├── dashboard
├── docs
├── engine
├── mobile
├── website
packages
├── documents
├── email
├── events
├── import
├── inbox
├── jobs
├── kv
├── location
├── notification
├── supabase
├── tsconfig
├── ui
├── utils
```

The `apps` directory contains the code for:

- `api`: The backend for Midday (supabase).

- `website`: Midday's website app ([midday.ai](https://midday.ai)).

The `packages` directory contains the code for:

- `documents`: OCR for reciepts.
